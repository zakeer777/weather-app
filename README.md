# weather-app
This project is a simple weather detection website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website allows the user to enter a location and then uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the current weather conditions for that location, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The information is then displayed on the website in an easy-to-read format. The project also utilizes CSS to create a visually appealing design that adapts to the current weather conditions. The website is fully responsive and can be viewed on any device.
